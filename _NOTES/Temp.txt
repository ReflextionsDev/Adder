[TODO]

[PASTEBIN]

fix hitboxes
add drop state and animation
add land state and animation


zealots stuck under trapdoors



- every so and so, remove first elemont from scent tracker?? for refresh.. (on enter a room, refresh?)



email raf - tricky bugs
(ask concernedape for advice? lol)

[walk anim reset when zombies change from chase to inspect, also sync animations... need buffer)
[z order - zombies are under ladder when they come up]

[zealots need climb anim]
[zealots need hit anim]

=======

primary problem is scents overriding drop, but shouldn't they be marked as investigated once they've been reached???


.. now scent is marked 

what if only mark scent if, zomb drops on it (now it's never marked checked tho)

---

[zombies don't follow player down (scent marked as checked already) may need to switch to overlap



[zealots don't persist if you fake them out on ldader, or shoot them on the way up] (CNR)

 
[zombies glide over drop point, or go into attack anim] - seems to happen if another zombie is in chase
[if zombie is spawned overlapping scent, they go bonk]


[zombies now bork at the bottom of ladders] - esp if you jump up onto ladder while they chase
[zombies keep trying to get up if trapdoor is closed]
[can close trap door on zombies if they're coming up / should be blocked]
 
 (check if on jump through) > can climb > drop 
 on drop, other LOS stuff needs to be ignored
