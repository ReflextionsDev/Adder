[TRAPDOOR]
Trapdoor clipping problem, potential solutions:
- Switch left piece z order based on players y height, if below floor peice start to overlap 
	- (but then it would overlap zombies and stuff)
- Make left piece invisbile, then visible when player is going under... (would still need floor piece?)
- Make wide enough that this won't happen (then I just need a bottom piece)
- 



Cut Hole
Hazard Hole
Trap Hole (leaves, weak floorboards)? (cracked floor) (debris?)
Hatch


Cellar Door (double width)
Double Hole

Gaps

Elevator Shaft
Elevator Doors
(Vent Systems?


,.
slow player down slightly when back walking
slow player down when goin up stairs, but speed up when going down
(disable dodge on stairs, but allow the player to slide down the stairs)


detail breaks (handrail, molding, etc)

before doing big asset request, ask for some artistic direction or advice... from someone?

==========
wide putin powerup

1/1000 chance of rtr death sound




Doors are busted af



Assemble the trapdoor stuff, and the frames, and then make automated spawners for them 
(automatically handles layers too) (automatically hiearchs)


trapdoors
- hole type / size
- door or no?
- trapdoor texture
- floor texture (can I make this a visual selection or hiearchy?) (disable transform with parent) (just assigned uids)
- ladder type / if at all
- cover/jump through? (or is this part of ladder?)




(trapdoor outline)


C3: cannot edit heirchy relations at runtime (disable transforms etc)

bug if player climbs ladder while shooting, reload ui is stuck

fall through platforms should stop player roll / slide

organize notes
Post C3 stuff
organize files
fix drive / cloud stuff


=======

need a filter for every hazard animation




.
make a flooring reference guide on asset layout, then can fill in as a property of hole or something


trapdoor outlines not working



MOVE HOLES TO SHADOW TILE LAYER!!
What about animated ones?
Animated tiles...


(get functional first)
after all is there>
make pipeline more effecient


zombies and hoeles?


(seperate player arms in zorder sorting)?``
(based on playeraim Y)
(also effect should maybe move to player layer)
(offset of -6)6w5435

(weapon z order stuff would be fixed if player was forced to climb)

(walkers need a backwards headshot animation)

(hazard 1 hole too small)
(player should maybe be able to shoot holes to break them, can then use strategeically)
