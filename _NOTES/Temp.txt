equipment needs vars from weapon >

cripple, headshot, gib, particleprefab





particleprefab

particles:
confetti
strike through line thingy
dust





need to get Adder payments again
so need to talk to raf
but need actual demo to show him

item that shoots out of gun a bullet, after hitting
(can only shoot once per clip, then it's spent and must reload) or maybe a one time use thing

base speed on projectile type



shuriken / arrow cloud
weapon that conjures up beams or spinning arrows or something arround players head, then releases them all when let go

then do weapon mod items apply to pistol???


,maybe weapon mods should be consolidated into items...
can revist later via weapon workbenches, or some kind of weapon xp system that levels them as you use
as game goes on, player should start to get control over items somehow.. either late game or system..
allow people to minmax builds, it's fun

gun that launches bullets, but as a physics object

throwing physics objects fucks up bullet angle
