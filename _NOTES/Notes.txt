- Level editor conversion
- C3 stuff

Working on Texture Creator for angled stairs.
- Would like to be able to export each component individually
- But also in bulk
- Would like prefab boxes to resize depening on texture size (like if a bigger baseboard is uploaded, the height should increase)
	- Steps of 9 pixel height, 8 of each object (Object height + 71(8x9)?)
