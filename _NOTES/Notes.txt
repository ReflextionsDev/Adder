*after editor is ready make a huuuge asset list for everything, after which I can hire level designers
**will have to add black outline parts to bottom of everything (can outsource)
***before doing big asset request, ask for some artistic direction or advice... from someone?
****have to disable collision for every tile 

========

switch roam w/ ceiling roam... > jump to roof >>>> but also need to verify for ceiling.. (should be in zone)

CeilingChase
CeilingInspect.. or don't inspect? > yes should prob exclude inspect
> on floor, they can chase normally.. only do single drop attack

if they hit a hole > fall to floor 
> if they hit a wall block > fall to floor

============

Adder theming...
title / music / setting / environment?

winter / zombievilla USA / 1950s america / parady of x?
Back Friday?
techno
religious overtones?
necromancy
edgy?

serious ? playfull? tounge in cheek?

tactical? / weighty

final station

///

start out w/ spooky vibes > progress into intense horde mode stuff

///

moody > better sfx, creature sfx, lighting, ambient sfx, dust particles, godrays, etc
more decay / detoriation, muzzle flash, post processing.. animated setpieces and environments, weather
High quality realistic SFX, echo and atmospheric... bullet trails, crows crowing, etc
make the world feel more real, floor boards creaking, random industrial noises when in city
wind and atmospheres, more gritty and ruined environments

more subtle soundtrack?

(slow the player down too..)

dark drones... and low passes (especially in city / industrial)
put a real mood into different biomes.. or these can fade into music
like this could fade into some post rock thin or smth
https://sonniss.com/product/tonal-elements-obscurum-dark-drones

(these would need kinda more intenitonal design though... and levels)

good explosion sfx

(different ambience per biome)


(sounds of zombies hitting the ground as they fall)
https://sonniss.com/product/bodyfall
could easily be overwhelming with too many tho

final station ost

but also duck gun and shits lul

spooky?

lack of theming, apathy of emotion... you have to feel into it

a real vision


(record footage and dub over with edgy sfx, ambience and music)..



===

or arcady...

health bars
more fx
punchy sfx
status alers when zombies see you (!)
gamey stuff

big text on item pickup.. or some notifcations of stuff

==========

I either need massive upscaling or downscalling..

more budget, more team, otherwise... turn into very simple horde shooter thingy (wave defense)

or biiiig wide levels, 

///

im trynna make something too big...


===

double down... or close up shop? or somewhere in middle


PLAY MORE ROGUES

rogue legacy, check out skull, risk of rain, final station

is my level design at odds with gameplay loop??


==============

big text on item pickup.. or some notifcations of stuff

==========

crash:
copy something
(attempt to paste (fails, this is another bug)
undo > crash

========
INSTAL::

(games)
fnv / mod installs 
fo4 / mod installs
halo mcc / halo infinite / hitman 2

construct 3 local
vegas
vs code
power toys
nvidia

========

lotto machines (for xp / mney / health)
draw a lever, get random amount, machine explodes


=====

dev roadmap >
mvp, new pitch, steam listing, partnership / team members

=======

sitcom item that adds a laugh track and other effects to the game 
(crowd goes OOH / gasp when you're low health, ahhh / laughs when you die, WOAH) 

(like eric andre YEAHHH on boss kill)
(wii sports style audio sounds)

=======

constructsnippets.com (NPM replacements)

post / share easily recycable code snippets (could limit to x per month, or sell memberships, promote patreon)

(sell bigger things as their own package / like platforming engine / etc)

ex: (timestamp conversion, dollar conversions, random array element, array shuffle, json to elements)

(allow submissions, voting, categories, discussions, revision requests / submission log)

(submission would either need approval, or you could have an 'offical system')

(personal / private libraries)
(layout stuff later on)
(ready made objects)

(mailing list / discord)

(just use screenshots for now, but eventually build transcriber or your own system for event blocks)

(license type stuff - public domain / open source) (partners / resource page)

later features:
user profiles, favorites, etc

======

item: dead bodies explode after 10 seconds

pitch the game as a platform: neeeds the possiblity to grow A LOT
need to be able to hire more / etc get rev share or do wahtever should there be an audience for it

need to find new publishers who can do

(also is more of a PC first design)

=======

show weapon ammo when switching
