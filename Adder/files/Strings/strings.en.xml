	<string id='dialogue_med_69'>I miss the comfort of paperwork.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_70'>War zone or emergency room? Hard to tell these days.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_71'>You're going to put me out of business at this rate.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_72'>Your health insurance probably doesn't cover... this.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_73'>Trust me, I've seen worse.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_74'>Ever hear the one about the doctor and the skeleton?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_75'>Fighting hurts, but boredom can kill too.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_76'>If you listen carefully, you can hear your body screaming.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_77'>Don't worry, I've patched up stranger things.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_78'>If I had a nickel for every bullet wound I've treated...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_79'>Who's your next of kin? Just in case...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_80'>Do you bleed? Let's find out.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_81'>You know, even doctors need doctors.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_82'>Is there a doctor in the house? Oh right, it's me.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_83'>Look at it this way, at least you're not dead...yet.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_84'>What's up, doc? Oh, sorry, I always wanted to say that.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_85'>Let's play a game. It's called 'Stay Alive'.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_86'>I wonder how much a human body is worth these days...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_87'>Fun fact: Did you know the human body has 206 bones? You're down to 205...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_88'>I could use a drink. Or five.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_89'>Laughing is the best medicine. After whatever I'm giving you, of course.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_90'>Death is just life's way of telling you to slow down.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_91'>If I had a penny for every near-death experience...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_92'>A moment on the lips, forever on the hips...and bullets, well they just rip through everything.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_93'>Hippocratic oath, schmippocratic oath.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_94'>My medical advice? Stop getting shot.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_95'>Laughter is the best medicine, but I think you need something stronger.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_96'>Are you sure you're not a punching bag?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_97'>If I had a dime for every time I've seen that wound...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_98'>Death is the poor man's doctor. Lucky for you, I'm rich in experience.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_99'>You're not dying on my watch. That's too much paperwork.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_med_100'>I used to be a pacifist. Look where that got me.</string>

	
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_1'>Guns don't kill people... but they sure help.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_2'>See something you like?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_3'>Looking for something with a little more kick?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_4'>Stick around. I'm sure we can find something to your liking.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_5'>Penny for your thoughts, bullet for your enemy.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_6'>Ever hear the phrase 'armed to the teeth'? I take it literally.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_7'>Remember, an empty gun is just a paperweight.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_8'>Big or small, I got 'em all.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_9'>You can never have too many bullets.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_10'>The only safety here is the one on your gun.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_11'>First rule of gun safety: Don't point it at anything you're not willing to destroy.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_12'>You can never be too armed in this world.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_13'>Got a light? Oh, wait... that's my laser sight.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_14'>Here's a tip: Aim for the head.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_15'>Peace through superior firepower. That's my motto.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_16'>I've got the right to bear arms, and sell them too.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_17'>Guns don't come with a safety manual. They come with a 'don't die' manual.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_18'>You know what they say about bringing a knife to a gun fight.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_19'>That's not a gun in my pocket... oh wait, it is.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_20'>Don't worry, I've got your caliber.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_21'>My guns might be second-hand, but they still pack a punch.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_22'>Ammo's on the house... Just kidding.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_23'>My philosophy? Shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everyone's dead try to ask a question or two.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_24'>Trust me, the bigger the gun, the smaller the... well, you get the idea.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_25'>You can talk the talk, but can you shoot the shoot?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_26'>In my world, the early bird gets the gun.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_27'>Running low? I can help with that.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_28'>Keep your friends close and your guns closer.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_29'>Ever danced with the devil? It's easier with a shotgun.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_30'>Remember, it's all fun and games until someone loses a bullet.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_31'>Life is a highway, and I'm the roadside bomb.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_32'>Think fast, shoot faster.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_33'>In the right hands, a pen can be mightier than a sword. But why risk it?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_34'>My favorite color? Gunmetal grey.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_35'>I don't usually do discounts. But for you? Full price.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_36'>They say talk is cheap. So are bullets. Choose wisely.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_37'>If you've got a problem, I've got a caliber for it.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_38'>Guns make the world go round... or stop, depending on where you point 'em.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_39'>If you can't hit your target, you're either drunk or not carrying one of my guns.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_weapon_40'>I've got a bullet with your name on it... Wait, that didn't come out right.</string>

	<string id='dialogue_ammo_1'>I sell ammo! And yes, it's overpriced.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_2'>This is a bullet. I also sell these. How convenient!</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_3'>I hear empty wallets make for empty magazines.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_4'>Bullets or beans, they both cost money. Guess which one keeps you alive longer.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_5'>Show me the money, then I'll show you the ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_6'>No ammo, no pew pew. No money, no ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_7'>Can't eat bullets, but you can't eat without them either.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_8'>I'm the lord of lead, the duke of destruction, the prince of projectiles.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_9'>You pay in lead? No? Shame, I have a lot of it.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_10'>Everyone's after a quick buck. Mine's just quicker than most.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_11'>Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy ammo. Same thing, right?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_12'>Bring cash, leave with brass. It's a simple exchange.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_13'>Don't you love the smell of fresh casings? And fresh money.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_14'>Let me check my list... Yep, still only accepting money.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_15'>What's green and smells like ammo? My wallet.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_16'>I can't hear you over the sound of coins jingling.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_17'>Why can't bullets be free? Because my yacht isn't.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_18'>It's not about the money... wait, yes it is.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_19'>Why do bullets whistle? They're just excited to empty your pockets.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_20'>There are two types of people. Those who buy ammo, and easy pickings.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_21'>Got any spare change? I've got spare shells.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_22'>They say money is the root of all evil. Guess that makes me the devil.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_23'>I'm a simple merchant. I see money, I sell ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_24'>Keep your friends close and your money closer.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_25'>Bullets are just angry little coins, right?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_26'>Money may not grow on trees, but it does buy ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_27'>Ammo today, more money tomorrow. It's the circle of life!</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_28'>I'm not greedy, I'm just... extremely enthusiastic about money.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_29'>Ammo. Cash only. No, I won't barter for your socks.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_30'>Your gun's appetite for ammo is only outmatched by my appetite for money.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_31'>The only safety I care about is financial security.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_32'>Money is the best armor. And I'm heavily armored.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_33'>In this world, cash is king and I'm the king's treasurer.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_34'>Ah, the sweet sound of coins clinking. Better than any gunshot.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_35'>Sure, take your time deciding. My yacht isn't going to buy itself.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_36'>Money can't buy you love, but it can buy you plenty of ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_37'>Pay now or pay later. It's always about the pay.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_38'>I accept two forms of payment: cash, and more cash.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_39'>Ran out of bullets? Well, I'm running out of patience. Pay up.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_40'>Welcome to my empire of ammunition. Payment up front.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_41'>Cash, credit, or… just kidding. Cash only.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_42'>Got some special deals... for special prices.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_43'>Nothing personal, it's just business.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_44'>Why do I sell ammo? Same reason you buy it. Survival.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_45'>I do have a heart, it's just made of gold.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_46'>Just think of me as your friendly, neighborhood, incredibly greedy ammo dealer.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_47'>Need ammo? Need money. See how that works?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_48'>If you can't afford ammo, you probably can't afford to live here.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_49'>Only thing that makes a louder bang than my ammo is my cash register.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_50'>Trust me, I'm worth every penny. And so is my ammo.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_51'>You know what they say, time is money. And I'm wasting both talking to you.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_52'>You look like someone who appreciates the value of a dollar... and a bullet.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_53'>Sure, the world's gone to hell, but on the bright side, business is booming.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_54'>I know, I know, my prices are criminal. What are you gonna do, call the cops?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_55'>I sell bullets. They're like tiny, deadly fundraisers for my retirement.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_56'>You know what they say, "If it's too expensive, you're too poor."</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_57'>You can't put a price on life. But you can on ammo. Weird, huh?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_58'>Pew, pew, pay, pay. It's the rhythm of life.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_59'>You're not paying for the ammo. You're paying for my exquisite taste.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_60'>I'm not in the ammo business. I'm in the money business.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_61'>Without ammo, you'll be nothing more than a snack for... whatever's out there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_62'>Those things out there sure love a fresh target. Keep loaded.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_63'>Don't skimp on ammo. It's the difference between hunter and hunted.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_64'>Bullets aren't just metal and powder. They're your ticket to tomorrow.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_65'>I'm not saying those things out there are waiting for you to run out of bullets, but...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_66'>Scared of the night? A full magazine can be pretty comforting.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_67'>You ever notice how those things get twitchy when they hear a gun click empty?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_68'>When your clip runs dry, that's when the real fun starts... for them.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_69'>If you can't afford bullets, I'd recommend running. Fast.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_70'>Ever wondered what it feels like to be chased without any ammo? Me neither.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_71'>Ammo: because "I ran out of bullets" is a terrible last word.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_72'>I sell peace of mind. And by that, I mean bullets.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_73'>I hear it's hard to count your money when you're running for your life. Better stock up.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_74'>Nothing says "not today" like a fully-loaded firearm.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_75'>It's a crazy world out there. And the crazy ones pay the best.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_76'>If you've got money, I've got ammo. If you've got neither, well... good luck.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_77'>I know it's pricey, but you'll thank me when you're not dinner for... well, you know.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_78'>Sure, you could save your money. But I don't think they accept cash.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_79'>You look like you could use more ammo. And I could use more money. Win-win.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_80'>The price of ammo goes up every time someone becomes... unavailable. Supply and demand.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_81'>Empty pockets won't save you out there. Neither will an empty gun.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_82'>You know what's more expensive than bullets? Becoming one of those things.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_83'>I'm in the survival business. You give me money, I help you survive.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_84'>Those things out there? They're not interested in your money. But I am.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_85'>If you're feeling brave, I've got some 'lightly used' ammo for half the price.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_86'>I do a roaring trade around full moons. Coincidence?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_87'>You can't bargain with them. But with me? Everything's negotiable. For a price.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_88'>A good deal for you, a better deal for me.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_89'>With my prices, you'd think bullets grow on trees. And hey, maybe they do in this crazy world.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_90'>I don't just sell ammo. I sell the chance to live another day.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_91'>The only currency those things understand is lead. And I've got plenty.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_92'>Sure, I charge a lot. But can you really put a price on not getting eaten?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_93'>You want to haggle? Okay, double the price and we'll start from there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_94'>You can always try fighting them off with harsh language. Let me know how that goes.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_95'>One bullet could save your life. Or it could make me rich. Let's find out.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_96'>This isn't charity. It's survival. So, cash or card?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_97'>Listen, I don't make the prices. I just enjoy them.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_98'>Bargain hunters die quick around here. Just saying.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_99'>Trust me, you'll miss these prices when you're out there without a bullet to your name.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_ammo_100'>Your money or your life? Just kidding. I'll take both.</string>

	<string id='dialogue_civ_4'>Is he really gone?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_5'>I just want her back...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_6'>All things considered, I'm just glad to be alive.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_7'>When will this nightmare end?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_8'>At least the traffic is better, eh?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_9'>Dude, I totally called this whole zombie apocalypse thing.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_10'>Freaking space aliens, man.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_11'>I hope my kids are safe.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_12'>Who are you?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_13'>What are you doing here?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_14'>Who let you in?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_15'>You better keep your promise.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_16'>Good luck out there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_17'>Howdy, stranger.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_18'>I hope your plan works.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_19'>Always good to meet new people.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_20'>How are things out there?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_21'>Strange times we live in.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_22'>You ever wonder if this whole thing is a simulation?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_23'>I just want to sleep...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_24'>That's a nice piece bro.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_25'>Why are you hiding your face?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_26'>Can you even see out of that hoodie?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_27'>Assuming those shots I heard earlier was you?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_28'>You must be exhausted.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_29'>This is not how I expected to die.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_30'>Uhh, I think you have some brains on your bandana.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_31'>I could kill for a warm bath.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_32'>At least we have shelter.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_33'>It haunts me everyday that I hung up.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_34'>What I wouldn't give to see their face again.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_35'>On the brightside, I have enough time to read now.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_36'>So like.... where's the military?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_37'>This is all just a test...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_38'>At least it wasn't nukes, I guess?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_39'>I'm telling you, Cthulu is responsible.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_40'>I'm a sucker for medieval castles.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_41'>Do you think we'll get through this?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_42'>I could use a cup of strong coffee.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_43'>I wish I knew how to handle a weapon that well.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_44'>How goes it?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_45'>What's up?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_46'>I mean, at least we're still alive... right?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_47'>I feel like I haven't slept in 28 days.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_48'>Got a smoke?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_49'>This whole thing feels rather... contrived.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_50'>"I'll be fine, don't worry" he said.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_51'>What's up?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_52'>Gearing up for another mission?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_53'>Hey, good luck out there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_54'>Come back safe.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_55'>Be careful out there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_56'>Watch yourself.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_57'>Do you remember when this all started?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_58'>YEET</string>

	<string id='dialogue_civ_60'>Anything new?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_61'>How goes the search?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_62'>Good hunting.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_63'>Keep your gun clean.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_64'>Hope that saftey is on.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_65'>I'm just glad to be in here.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_66'>What's up boss?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_67'>Good looking out.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_68'>Keeping it real?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_69'>Kon'nichiwa!</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_70'>Hey man.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_71'>Dude... you might want to shower.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_72'>Another morning comes...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_73'>Could you find me some jelly beans?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_74'>Patrolling out here almost makes me...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_75'>And they say war never changes.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_76'>Howdy.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_77'>I can hear them in my sleep.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_78'>I am freaking out, man.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_79'>You think the doc's plan will work?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_80'>Keep up the fight.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_81'>If this plan works, I'll be amazed.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_82'>I'll keep praying for you.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_83'>Maybe you're like the chosen one or something.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_84'>Keep your fire burning.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_85'>We have to keep fighting.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_86'>I need a flask.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_87'>I need a a nap.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_88'>We're trying our best.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_89'>How you holding up?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_90'>I miss my guitar more than anything.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_91'>Times like these make you wonder.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_92'>Hard to get any sleep out here.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_93'>I keep hearing things...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_94'>How are you still alive?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_95'>That doctor is kind of a shifty fellow.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_96'>I'm on lookout.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_97'>So, what was your job in the previous world?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_99'>What, you military or something?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_100'>Do you think a frying pan would stop a bullet?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_101'>Do you have a vendetta against doors?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_102'>I wonder how many bullets you've shot.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_103'>I used to be a pro athlete you know.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_104'>I know words, I have the best words.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_105'>I hope this place is structurally sound.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_106'>I think I'm coming down with something.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_107'>It's a bit chilly out.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_108'>Staying safe?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_109'>I'm practicing beatboxing.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_110'>I bet you can't do a backflip.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_111'>Your bandana is sick!</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_112'>I heard some weird stuff last night.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_113'>When was the last time you slept?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_114'>I've always loved nature.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_115'>I think I hiked here once.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_116'>What do you think it's like overseas?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_117'>The good news is I don't have work tommorow.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_118'>We should get a dog.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_119'>We're safe out here, right?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_120'>Just keeping watch.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_121'>My eyes are peeled.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_122'>How do you think this all happened?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_123'>Do you think they feel?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_124'>I'm glad I'm on your side.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_125'>Yo, what if this thing was an inside job?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_126'>So like, are we calling them zombies or not?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_127'>I don't know how I'm still breathing.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_128'>You stink!</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_129'>Man, I am just beat.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_123'>Hey, I won't question your methods.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_124'>Nothing's getting past me.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_124'>I'm sooooo bored.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_125'>It gets lonely out here.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_126'>You look busy.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_127'>You got enough ammo there?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_128'>I could use some action.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_129'>You got a deck of cards?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_130'>I'm ready to fight.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_131'>You doing okay?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_132'>The nights are the worst...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_133'>Could you find me some peanut butter?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_134'>I hope we'll see a new day.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_135'>Hello there.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_136'>Have you seen my cat?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_137'>Are you from around here?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_138'>We need to stick together.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_139'>Good to see a familiar face.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_140'>Do you have any food?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_141'>I wish I had a radio.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_142'>I used to work around here.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_143'>What's the latest?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_144'>Got any spare ammo?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_145'>What's the weather like out there?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_146'>I think I heard something.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_147'>Just another day in paradise.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_148'>What's that you got there?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_149'>Have you seen any other survivors?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_150'>We'll get through this.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_151'>Any idea what's going on?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_152'>Keep your head down.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_153'>Thanks for everything.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_154'>I never thought I'd live to see this.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_155'>Could use some fresh air.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_156'>You're a good shot.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_157'>Is it safe?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_158'>Haven't seen you before.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_159'>What brought you here?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_160'>Keep the faith.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_161'>I can't remember the last meal I had.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_162'>Where did you learn to fight like that?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_163'>We need to find a way out.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_164'>Is it always this quiet?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_165'>Ever think about what you'll do when this is over?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_166'>I can't believe it's come to this.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_167'>Remember, aim for the head.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_168'>Haven't had a decent cup of coffee in months.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_169'>I hope my family is safe.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_170'>Do you hear that?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_171'>We can't give up hope.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_172'>Who's in charge here?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_173'>I heard there's a safe zone to the north.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_174'>I had a dream about green fields last night.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_175'>I can't sleep anymore.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_176'>Do you think there's a way to reverse all this?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_177'>There's got to be a cure, right?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_178'>I lost my glasses.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_179'>What day is it?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_180'>I used to be a teacher.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_181'>I saw something moving in the shadows.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_182'>I think I'm getting sick...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_183'>Never thought I'd be fighting for my life every day.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_184'>Is this real or am I dreaming?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_185'>I think we should move out at dawn.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_186'>I could use a good laugh.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_187'>How do you stay so calm?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_188'>I never got to say goodbye...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_189'>We need more watchmen at night.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_190'>I've been having nightmares lately.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_191'>It's quiet... too quiet.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_192'>I feel like we're being watched.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_193'>I miss the simple things.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_194'>I could kill for a candy bar right now.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_195'>Who's gonna save us now?</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_196'>I don't know if I can take much more of this.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_197'>I've been alone for a long time.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_198'>I used to love the sunrise...</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_199'>Hold on to hope, it's all we got.</string>
	<string id='dialogue_civ_200'>Birds have been riled up lately.</string>
